This is a time series/forecasting project.

With ten years of crime data in Seattle, can the number of crimes in the upcoming week be predicted?

Seattle_crime_summary: A detailed summary of the project.         
Seattle_crime_presentation: A pdf of a presentation. It may not make sense as a stand-alone.     
Seattle_crime_test_models:  This is documentation of some of the models run.  The input is not apples to apples so it is not
included in the final code.       
Seattle_crime_final_code: Python code for the project.  The final_plots code is good for the OLS/ARIMA/Prophet, but
the final_plots_code_video is better for the LSTM.    

Seattle_crime_input:           
The data in the file is the RMSE for some of the models run.    

The crime data is too large to upload to Github.  It can be found on the City of Seattle website.  The weather data can be found on the NOAA website.
