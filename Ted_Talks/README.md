This is a natural language processing (NLP)/Clustering project.

Ted Talks have about five tags describing the talk, one of which is usually a general category:  Business, Global, Technology,
Entertainment, Design, and Science.    
Can the general category be predicted on a one sentence summary?     
Can the hundreds of categories on the Ted website be reduced to 10-20?    

Ted_Talks_summary: A detailed summary of the project.    
Ted_Talks_presentation: A pdf of a persentation. It may not make sense as a stand-alone.    
Ted_Talks_code: Python code for the project.    
Ted_Talks_input: The data came from Kaggle.
